<h1> A Generic Approach to Identify Sector Specific Critical Information Infrastructure <h1>
  
 The approach factors data that is publicly available on Volume and Value for identification of critical infrastucture in a critical sector
   
<h2> Critical Information Infrastructure - Volume and Value Tool <h2>
  
 a) A tool that extracts data into a MS-Access DB (this is used as it is generally available for most of the users and easy to handle with basic understanding of technology.
 b) The data from MS-Access is copied into MS-Excel for rank aggregation. This can also continue to be in MS-Access
 c) Rank Aggregation (https://github.com/lalitsanagavarapu/NCIIPC/blob/master/rankagg_nciipc.py) and Kendal Tau methods (https://github.com/lalitsanagavarapu/NCIIPC/blob/master/kendaltau.py) are used to identify the top most ranks in critical infrastructure
 d) The results can be used by Govt, Regulators and Organizations for protecting CII
